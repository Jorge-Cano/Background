          <p class="resume-item-copy">I have been on the frontlines of tech startups in Austin. I'm quick to recognize when to automate tasks, isolating issues, training, creating resources, and acheiving outcomes. I learned html and css in my CSM role, I quickly picked up Excel in Data Analytics along with webscraping in Mozenda. Give me a new platform and I will squeeze something out of it. There's few things I love more than seeing a project through to the finish line. It's a blessing to see the fruits of your labor, I aim for wins but even losses have a lot of a story to tell.</p>
