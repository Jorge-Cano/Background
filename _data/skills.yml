# Adaptability
- skill: Adaptable, Collaborative, Customer-Centric
  description: I have been on the frontlines and helped to scale a handful of tech startups in Austin. I'm quick to recognize when to automate tasks, identifying root issues, product trainings, resource generation and documentation. I learned to utilize html, css, javascript tools in my CSM role. I quickly picked up advanced excel functions and data mining tools in my Data Analytics role, and Webscraping and DOM manipulation with Mozenda were key in developing leads. Give me a new platform and I will squeeze something out of it. There are few things I love more than seeing a project through to the finish line.
