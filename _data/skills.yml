# Adaptability
- skill: Adaptable, Collaborative, Customer-Centric
  description: I have been on the frontlines and helped to scale a handful of tech startups in Austin. I'm quick to recognize when to automate tasks, identifying root issues, product trainings, resource generation and documentation. I learned to use web development tools in my CSM role, I quickly picked up advanced excel functions in Data Analytics along with Webscraping and DOM manipulation with Mozenda. Give me a new platform and I will squeeze something out of it. There are few things I love more than seeing a project through to the finish line.
